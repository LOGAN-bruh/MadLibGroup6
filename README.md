### MadLib Generator
This Mad Libs application is an interactive word-game engine designed to turn your creative input into hilarious, unpredictable narratives. Upon launching, you are presented with a variety of themed scenarios—ranging from space expeditions to kitchen disasters—and prompted to provide a specific set of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Once you’ve entered your words, the program instantly weaves them into a formatted story, allowing you to see your unique vocabulary choices come to life in a completed, often comical, tale.
